# RangeColorPlus
A World of Warcraft: Classic Era addon that highlights out-of-range skills in the action bar red.

RangeColorPlus is extremely lightweight and simply enhances the default out of range indicator in the action bar (coloring the hotkey number red). Instead, it highlights the entire skill icon so it's much easier to see.

<h4>Features</h4>
- Minimalist addon that retains the design of the default Blizzard UI
- Plug and play with no setup required
- Customize the color by typing /rr and entering RGBA values
- Saves color varaibles by character

<h4>Known Issues / To-Do</h4>
- Use the color-picker to choose a color and transparency in addition to the chat command.
